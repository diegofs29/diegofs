    ¡Hola! My name is Diego. I'm a Software Engineer and developer from Asturias, Spain. Professionally, I work
    as a Mobile Developer, using both Android with Kotlin and Java as languages as well as iOS with Swift.
    Nonetheless I also enjoy SysAdmin work and Videogame Development (which I do a lot on my free time).
    I'm very passionate about software development. I hope you enjoy my personal corner at the world wide web!
