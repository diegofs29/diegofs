¬°Hola üòä! My name is Diego. I'm a software engineer from the Principality of Asturias (Spain).
More specifically I'm based in the municipality of Siero, which I love wholeheartedly. 

## Studies
I studied my degree at the University of Oviedo at the 
[School of computer Engineering](https://markdown.es/sintaxis-markdown/#links) 
between the years 2017 and 2022. There I learned a lot of things about computer science,
software engineering and programming (among other things). I also made lots of friends but
that's beyond the point.

After that, in 2024 I started a master's degree in Development and Operations (DevOps) at
the International University of La Rioja. There I learned a lot about DevOps, SecDevOps,
networks and agile project management (among other things, again).

## Work experience
I have been working at [guppy](https://www.guppy.es/en/) üê† since 2022 the month after I
graduated from university. There I'm the responsible for both iOS and Android apps. That
means that nowadays I'm a Mobile Developer, well versed in both Kotlin and Swift (as well
as familiarized with both enviroments).

## Software related hobbies
I love to develop videogames in my free time. I usually do all the art and programming
myself, though they are not masterpieces I still love my own games. I like to think that
I'm improving at it.

I like to build my own home server little by little. I have an HP mini PC that consumes
very little but packs a punch. There I have my servers, Gitea, a reverse proxy and a lots
of things to come in the future.
